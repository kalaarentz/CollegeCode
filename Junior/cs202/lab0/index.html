			<h2> Academics </h2>

				<h3> High School </h3>
				<p> I graduated from a small high school about an hour away from La Crosse. 				Cashton is well-known for there Track & Field Team. Our FFA chapter is the 				largest club in our school. </p>

				<p> The classes that I enjoyed the most were english and science.  I did 				take a Game Design class online my senior year of school. My favorite class 				was my Creative Writing class. </p>

				<h3> College </h3>
				<p> I went into my freshmen year as a Computer Science major. Eventually I 				changed to Undecided but continued on finishing a minor in Computer 					Science. I have mostly taken required classes, so I have not had any 				electives in Computer Science except now. </p>
			
				<p> My favorite GenEd class I took was my Intro to Infectious Disease 				class. It was curious to learn about 	Infectious Diseases and how countries 				deal with them in the past or future. </p>

			<h2> Career Objectives </h2>

				<h3> Short Term </h3>
				<p> My main goal of this year is to research internships. I plan on doing 				an internship during my summer. I would be interested in tutoring for some 				of the lower level CS courses. </p>

				<h3> Long Term </h3>
				<p> I have no idea what my long term goals are yet. I have not taken a lot 				of electives so I have no idea what field I would like to go into. Working 				for EPIC sounds cool. </p>
