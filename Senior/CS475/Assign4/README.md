# CS 475 - Computer Graphics
## Assignment 4

This repository contains the files for Assign4. The files come from VR-Examples example 1. The requirements of the assignment are described in the course notes. This code uses the OpenVR system and is build using the Visual Studio compiler, linker and make programs. 

## What to Do


- In GitLab, fork this project to make a copy under your GitLab account.
- Clone _your_ copy of the project to your development machine to the same location as GL-Examples (so they can both share the SDL2 installation). 
- Implement the required functions. 
- The Makefile contains a target for ``nmake hw-4``.
- When complete, 
    - take a short screen capture movie of your app
    - ``make clean`` to remove object files and executables
    - ``git add .`` to add your changes
    - ``git commit -m "commit message"``
    - ``git push -u origin master``
    - add me as a "reporter" member of your project repository
    - create an issue on your project repository, listing me as assignee, with a title of "Submit for grading"
