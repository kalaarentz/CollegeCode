# CS 475 - Computer Graphics
## Assignment 1

This repository contains the files for Assign-1. The files follow the pattern used in the GL-Examples. The requirements of the assignment are described in the course notes. Briefly, you are to implement, in stdModels.cpp, two functions. One to create a cone model are assigned face normals and the other to create a torus model with smooth normals. 

## What to Do


- In GitLab, fork this project to make a copy under your GitLab account.
- Clone _your_ copy of the project to your development machine to the same location as GL-Examples (so they can both share the SDL2 installation). 
- Implement the required functions. 
- The Makefile contains a target for ``make assign-1``.
- When complete, 
    - ``make clean`` to remove object files and executables
    - ``git add .`` to add your changes
    - ``git commit -m "commit message"``
    - ``git push -u origin master``
    - add me as a "reporter" member of your project repository
    - create an issue on your project repository, listing me as assignee, with a title of "Submit for grading"
