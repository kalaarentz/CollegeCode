# CS 475 - Computer Graphics
## Assignment 3

This repository contains the files for Assign3. The files come from Ex12. The requirements of the assignment are described in the course notes.

## What to Do


- In GitLab, fork this project to make a copy under your GitLab account.
- Clone _your_ copy of the project to your development machine to the same location as GL-Examples (so they can both share the SDL2 installation).
- Implement the required functions.
- The Makefile contains a target for ``make assign-3``.
- When complete,
    - take a short screen capture movie of your app
    - ``make clean`` to remove object files and executables
    - ``git add .`` to add your changes
    - ``git commit -m "commit message"``
    - ``git push -u origin master``
    - add me as a "reporter" member of your project repository
    - create an issue on your project repository, listing me as assignee, with a title of "Submit for grading"


- SHADER Assignment
- appCtl.cpp is the file that lists all the letters on the keyboard and the corresponding state on the screen (globe, uvsphere, chicken, etc)
