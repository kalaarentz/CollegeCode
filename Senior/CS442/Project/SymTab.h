/* SymTab.h

  This file defines the interface to a simple symbol table.
  For the purposes of this module a symbol table is abstractly
  viewed as a collection of entries each associating a name
  with a single attribute which is taken to be a (void *).
  This allows the user to associate a name with an arbitrary
  structure of attribute information which the user creates
  and maintains. A symbol table can optionally reference a
  parent symbol table to support names in nested scopes.

  The following functionality is provided
  - symbol table creation and destruction
  - getting and setting an entry's attribute pointers
  - getting an entry's name string
  - enumerating the contents of the table

/* CreateSymTab   Create and return a reference to a symbol table of
                  approximately Size many entries. ScopeName is a name to
                  describe the scope of the table and maybe NULL. If

                  the table.

   DestroySymTab  Destroy all storage associated with a Symbol Table which
                  is under the table's control. This function can only free
                  storage that has been allocated by this module. Any
                  storage allocated for attributes associated with an entry
                  must be freed before the table is destroyed. This can be
                  done by creating an entryFree() function and using the
